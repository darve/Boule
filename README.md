# Boule (no longer maintained)

Modular static-site generator. This is a project I built when I was working on a project that was being integrated into a CMS by a seperate team, so we needed a way of prototyping front-end components in their various states without any kind of actual back-end.

Boule uses node and various types of template to generate test pages for the components we were developiing, so we could see them in their various states, and so the QA team could play with them in a meaningful way.

It uses a few slightly out of date bits of tech such as Gulp, but I think its worth leaving on here as a public repo in case it helps anyone.
